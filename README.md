## Overview

The **CrowdTangle Media Extension** is a Chrome browser extension designed to enhance the capabilities of CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool that helps marketers and researchers monitor content across the platform. This extension automates the process of discovering new pages that match specific search criteria but are not yet included in your curated lists.

## Features

- **Advanced Parameterized Search**: Run searches on CrowdTangle with specific parameters such as country, keywords, and page titles.
- **List Exclusion**: Exclude pages that are already in your existing CrowdTangle lists.
- **Automated Scrolling & Data Collection**: The extension automatically scrolls through search results over a specified time period.
- **CSV Export**: Generate a CSV file of newly discovered pages that match your criteria.
- **Easy Integration with CrowdTangle**: Upload the generated CSV file to CrowdTangle to effortlessly expand your curated lists.

## Use Cases

This extension is particularly useful for:

- **Media Monitoring**: Tracking new sources related to specific topics or regions.
- **Disinformation Research**: Identifying emerging narratives, misinformation, and signs of Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior.
- **Machine Learning Model Training**: Collecting data for training AI models on content classification.
- **Political & Social Analysis**: Mapping out networks of influence within specific online communities.

## How It Works

1. **Perform a Search in CrowdTangle**:
   - Set search parameters (e.g., country = Italy, keywords = Casapound, Fratelli d'Italia, Lega, Vox Italia, Marcello Veneziani).
   - Optionally exclude pages that are already on your list (e.g., "Far Right Italian Politics").
2. **Run the Extension**:
   - Click the CrowdTangle Media Extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
